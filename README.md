# Complex Network Representations for Coupled Dynamical Systems: Dynamical Networks

Install package as: 

    pip install Dynamical-Networks

See examples here: https://github.com/myersau3/Dynamical_Networks/tree/main/Examples

These examples are for simulating the power grid and manufacturer supplier networks.

This repository holds the Python code for analyzing and creating complex network representations of coupled dynamical systems.
